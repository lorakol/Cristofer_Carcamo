The near vision for the patient intake module will be to connect the module to a database and create API commands to transfer the data. Stakeholders: Patients, Receptionist, Mangers Persona:  Jon, age 57,is a Social worker at Iron Gate Prison in Boston, Massachusetts There he gets to understand his clients and talk about their troubled pasts. But going to work has been getting harder and harder for Jon as his facility has a lot of stairs and his knees have started to cramp up every so often. Fearful that this new found pain might start to hinder his work experience as well as his hobby of mountain biking he decided he was going to get his knees looked at by a medical professional. As Jon was old fashioned and went to school back in the day where all you needed from NYU masters in social work was a pencil and a stack of books, he was widely unfamiliar with technology.  Backlog URL: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2605556 Definition of Ready for product backlog: Patient inputs information: Jon decides he wants to go get his knees finally looked at by a medical professional. He hasnâ€™t been to a hospital in quite some time and realizes that he might have to register all his information in a waiting room full of people coughing and sneezing all over him. A thought makes him shudder to his very core, nevertheless his knee was not going to get any better. He decides he will call and ask how long the wait time is going to be. Tom answers the phone and tells Jon he can go onto the SME website and put all his information online. Tom emails Jon a detailed word doc on how to go to the website and where to place the information. Tom walks Jon through making a username and password and then hangs up allowing Jon to fill out all his personal information on the website. Jon clicks submit and Tom calls Jon up to inform him that the information was received correctly and they have a space for him to come in that afternoon at 3pm.",
